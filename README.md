Pneumo-ABM
==========
Updated January 2016.

Pneumo-ABM simulates an individual-based model of the dynamics of multiple pneumococcal serotypes. It is based on the model presented by Cobey et al. in 2012 Science [1], and has a much simpler demographic model but also new functionality that allows the fitting of transmission and vaccine parameters to match observed carriage data.
